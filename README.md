## Resources
### Books
* [C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition)](https://github.com/chovanj/Microcontrollers/blob/master/Resources/Books/C_Primer_Plus_6th_Edition.pdf) - is a great book about C language which is inevitable for programming microcontrollers.
* [The Art of Electronics](https://artofelectronics.net/the-book/table-of-contents/) - is a popular textbook dealing with analog and digital electronics.
