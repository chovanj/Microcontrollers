# Microcontrollers

This repository is my storage for everything related with programming microcontrollers of any kind.

## Books
* [C Primer Plus (Sixth Edition)](https://ptgmedia.pearsoncmg.com/images/9780321928429/samplepages/0321928423.pdf) - is a great book about C language which is inevitable for programming microcontrollers.
* [The Art of Electronics](https://artofelectronics.net/the-book/table-of-contents/) - is a popular textbook dealing with analog and digital electronics.
